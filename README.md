  Faver 
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  What is it?
  -----------

	Faver is a helpful shopping tool where users can find 
	items ranging from common to unique by searching a combined 
	database of over 1,000 online retailers at once. Users can 
	add uncommonly found items they've purchased to Faver's 
	database to let other users know where to find their own. 
	Faver's unique feature of pinpointing local retailers with 
	unique items offers an alternative to hunting through garage 
	sales and flea markets.
